# AI for Healthcare: Disease Diagnosis Predictive Model

## Overview

The **AI for Healthcare** project is a Java-based application that develops a predictive model for disease diagnosis using machine learning techniques. It utilizes medical datasets to train a model that can predict disease outcomes based on user-provided input. This project aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in the healthcare domain, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions based on predictive analytics.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Implements a logistic regression model to predict disease diagnosis based on input features.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing for easy input of medical features and display of predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Integrates visualization components to showcase model accuracy and performance metrics (to be added).
- **Modular Design**: The project is structured with separate classes for data loading, model training, and user interface, promoting maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **Apache Spark**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Apache Commons CSV**: For reading CSV files containing medical data.
- **JFreeChart**: (Optional) For future data visualization of model accuracy and metrics.
- **Java Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface.
